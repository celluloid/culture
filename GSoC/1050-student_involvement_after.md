### How will you keep students involved with your community after GSoC?

Organizations who use Celluloid will be offering internships to top performing students. We have many disciplines a student start a career in after school, both in Open Source directly, and in organizations all over the world.

In the past Celluloid mentors and students have been known to keep contact long after GSoC is over. We draw students into the organic relationships and community ties we normally have in our existing sub-culture.
