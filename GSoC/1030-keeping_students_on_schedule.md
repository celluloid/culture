### How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?

We will hold short but frequent status meetings every two weeks at the longest ( but aspiring to weekly ) - implementing the Agile and Scrum methodology's style of status and assistance meetings.

We will treat the group of mentors as a team, the students as a team, the students and mentors as teams, and treat the entire organization as a pool of talent and assistance for all the other students and mentors in the organization. If anyone encounters a roadblock, they have plenty of support.

Rather than treat projects as a water-tight compartments, we will cross-motivate students: We will share successes, draw attention to unique dilemmas, etc. We will encourage, showcase progress, and foster a spirit of respectful competition between projects for mentors and students alike.

And as mentioned, will have a non-mentor organization administrator acting as a communications and performance monitor, mentor assistant, and "cheer-leader" for both students and mentors.
