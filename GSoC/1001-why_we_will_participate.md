### Why does your org want to participate in Google Summer of Code?

This year is pivotal for us. Celluloid is approaching "1.0" across its suite of Ruby gems. We need students' attention focused on Celluloid itself now.

We want to participate directly this year, for three reasons:

1) We grew beyond the scope of umbrella organizations and are establishing a new non-profit corporation.

2) We are important to one of the most epic shifts in software. With us, any coder can create parallel, asynchronous, concurrent, and/or distributed systems, simply. We hold & gain ground in a fierce, ordinarily complicated, multi-threaded multi-core space; fought over by Erlang/Elixr, Go, Rust, Akka, etc.

3) We are important to Ruby: a) We maintain many widely used libraries, and have millions of downloads. b) We bring design diversity to Ruby. The vast majority of Rubyists tend toward one design approach: Rails+Rack. We offer alternatives sparing Ruby from monoculture. c) We cause Ruby itself to evolve. We use and stretch nearly every aspect of every Ruby engine.
