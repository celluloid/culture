### How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?

We have many contributors with management experience. One of our administrators will not be mentoring a student, but instead will be responsible for assessing public communication and activity, providing encouragement and support. We will also be creating healthy competition between mentors.

All mentors and students will be present in Ryver. All student activity ( code and communication ) will be visible, and administrators will be monitoring student activity and mentor interactions. On a weekly basis, before prolonged trouble or inactivity, at least one person in addition to the mentor involved will know a mentor or student began to fall behind the stated project goals, and/or the program's expectations.

Celluloid is a tight community who will be encouraging both mentors and students. But we will also be offering incentives to top performing students, offering prizes such as stickers, shirts, virtual server credits, internships at Celluloid supporting organizations, etc.
