### How will you get your students involved in your community during GSoC?

In addition to Ryver, we will be engaging students on GitHub, Hangouts, IRC, Twitter, Google Groups, even LinkedIn. These will be all introduced and utilized by students during the GSoC program. By the time the program is over, the students will be new community members who are each deeply connected.

Our quick but frequent Agile-style meetings will further orient the students to the wider community, rather than just speaking with their mentor. By the end, everyone will know each other. Students will become aware of opportunities to work in the community, and community veterans will have a chance to observe -- then establish relationships which lead to their own businesses and other organizations engaging students as interns, future contractors, technical co-founders, and more.
